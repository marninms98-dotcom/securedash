# Claude Code Instructions — ops-dashboard / SecureSuite

## Bug Tracking

When Shaun says **"new bug"**, **"log a bug"**, **"add a bug"**, **"found a bug"**, or any similar phrase:
1. Ask for (or infer from context) the bug description and where it lives
2. Add it as a new row to the bug list in `C:\Users\shaun\.claude\projects\C--Coding-Projects-ops-dashboard\memory\bugs.md`
3. Confirm it's been logged with the bug number

When Shaun asks for the **bug list**, **"what bugs do we have"**, **"show me bugs"**, or similar:
1. Read `C:\Users\shaun\.claude\projects\C--Coding-Projects-ops-dashboard\memory\bugs.md`
2. Present the full table clearly, grouped by status (Open → In Progress → Fixed)
